# Crop-Remmendation-and-Yield-Prediction
In this Project we have used Machine Learning techniques to develop two models for crop remmendation and prediction.
The first model suggests the crop that is suitable for the land by considering the Natural Parameters of Soil,rainfall and so on.The Second model takes the output of a first model and predicts the yield of the crop.
